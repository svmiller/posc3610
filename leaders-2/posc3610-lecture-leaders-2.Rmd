# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Discuss what we know about leader turnover, leader attributes, and inter-state conflict.*


### Confrontation of the Day: MIC#2331

```{r mic-of-the-day, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# knitr::include_graphics("mic2331.jpg")

p1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("mic2331.jpg", scale = 0.8)
p2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("mic2331-3.png", scale = 1.1)

plot_grid(p1, p2)
```

### MIC#2331

- *Who*: United Kingdom vs. Iraq and UAR (14 July 1958 - 2 Nov. 1958)
- *Why*: overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy; threats to Jordan
- *What happened (synopsis)*:
  - 14 July: overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy, UKG goes on alert
  - 17 July: show of force starts
  - 19 October: Britain starts withdrawal from Jordan
  - 2 November: Britain completes withdrawal from Jordan
  
### Leaders and Conflict

1. How do survival incentives shape decisions for/against war?
2. How are states' decisions for war shaped by which leader is in power?

# Leader Attributes and War
## Ex Post, Ex Ante
### Leader Attributes and War

If successive leaders evaluate war/peace differently, then leader turnover can produce variation in war and peace.

- *Ex post*
- *Ex ante*

### Ex Post Leader Turnover and War

- *Unit of analysis*: politically relevant directed dyad-years
- *DV*: Confrontation onset, escalation to war (A vs. B, GML MID v.2.2.1)
- *IVs*: irregular leader turnover in dyad-year, regular leader turnover in dyad-year
    - Benchmarks to comparison against *no* leader turnover in dyad-year
- *Controls*: land contiguity, relative power (W/S), major power in dyad, defense pact (CoW), minimum democracy, minimum GDP per capita, minimum level of militarization

## Which Leaders Are More Likely to Use Force?
### Which Leaders Are More Likely to Use Force?

- *Unit of analysis*: leader-years
- *DV*: did leader initiate a conflict in leader-year?
- *IVs*: leader gender,  military service, was leader previously a rebel, war outcome in previous military (rebel) service, years of experience in politics before becoming a leader, level of education
- *Controls:* CINC, level of democracy, leader age, leader year in office

## Leader Attributes and Conflict Initiation
### Leader Attributes and Conflict Initiation

- Women are more likely to initiate conflicts than men.
- Leaders with military experience are more likely to initiate conflicts than leaders without military experience.
- Leaders who were previously rebels are more generally likely to initiate conflicts.
- More experienced leaders (in office, in politics) are more likely to initiate conflicts.

## The Biden Hypothesis
### 

> Mark my words. It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy. The world is looking. We’re about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old senator president of the United States of America. Remember, I said it standing here, if you don’t remember anything else I said. Watch, we're going to have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy.
>
> --- **Joe Biden (Oct. 19, 2008)**


### Are Younger Leaders More Likely to Be Targeted?

### Testing the Biden Hypothesis

A test of the Biden hypothesis:

- *Unit of analysis*: politically relevant directed leader-dyad-years
- *DV*: Initiation of a dispute (A vs. B, GML MID v.2.2.1)
- *IVs*: Leader age (A,B), year in office (A,B)
- *Controls*: minimum democracy, female leader (B), relative power, land contiguity, (CoW) defense pact

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

- Leader turnover is associated with conflict onset (if not escalation), ex post.
- Identifying ex ante leader turnover's relationship with conflict is more difficult.
- Conflict initiation is (generally) the domain of the older, more experienced leaders.
- Female leaders are relatively rare, and their association with conflict is more about the select countries in which they emerged.
- There might be a distinction in the military effect, between those who fought and those who didn't.
