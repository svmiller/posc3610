# What We Know About Alliances
## What Is An Alliance?
### What is an Alliance?

Alliances are formal written agreements signed:

- by official representatives of
- at least two independent states, that
- include promises to aid a partner or remain neutral in case of conflict.

### What is an Alliance?

Some features of alliances:

- Anticipatory
- Typically unconcerned with cases of civil war or coup threats
- Non-binding
- Either bilateral or multilateral

### Typology of Alliances

We have a typology of alliances contingent on data source.

- Correlates of War [CoW] (Gibler, 2009)
- Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions [ATOP] (Leeds et al., 2002)

### CoW Typology

- Defense
- Neutrality
- Nonaggression
- Entente

## Why Form Alliances?
### Why Form Alliances?

Traditional argument: states use alliances for security.

- Quick way of aggregating capabilities toward some adversary.

This led to the familiar balancing/bandwagoning debate.

- Balancing: join weaker side to stop domination
- Bandwagoning: join stronger side to join in spoils of domination


### Why Form Alliances?

Walt's balance of threat theory offers small refinement here.

- States balance against perceived threat, not power.
- Power is instrumental to threat.

Sources of threat:

- Offensive power
- Proximity
- Aggregate capabilities
- Offensive intentions

### Better View of Alliance Formation

States seek an optimal trade-off between security and autonomy.

- Weaker states seek security from stronger states against perceived threats
- Stronger states trade security commitments for policy gains elsewhere.
- The weaker state concedes some autonomy for security.

Would square well with patterns we observe:

- U.S.-Kuwait/Saudi Arabia.
- Marshall Plan in NATO

### Better View of Alliance Formation

States A and B generally form an alliance to signal to State C.

- Assume: B and C have some divisive issue, for which A supports B.
- And: alliances are costly to form (i.e. transaction, opportunity) and costly to break (i.e. reputation, audience).

Therefore: A and B form a costly alliance when:

- A and wants to better empower B/deter C.
- Alliances are relatively inexpensive to form.
- Alliances are costly to break.

## Empirical Findings
### Who Forms Alliances?

Empirical analysis for today: what do we know about who forms alliances more generally?

<!-- ### Evaluating a Regression Analysis -->

<!-- I mention there are three things to do when evaluating a regression analysis. -->

<!-- 1. Know (however, general) the data used. -->
<!-- 2. Know what the objects in the regression table are saying. -->
<!-- 3. Know what the regression table *isn't* saying. -->

### Lai and Reiter's (2000) Data

The first step is to know what the variables used are supposed to capture.

- Dependent variable: states are allied (Y/N)
    - CoW alliances and ATOP alliances

Analysis is from older data. 

- CoW domain (1816-1992)
- ATOP domain (1816-1944)

### Lai and Reiter's (2000) Data

Lai and Reiter have three hunches about what explains alliance formation.

1. Regime similarity
    - Joint democracy
    - Polity difference (i.e. testing for "cats and dogs" effect)
2. Cultural similarity/homophily
    - Joint religion/ethnicity/language
3. Shared threat
    - Conflict relations (i.e. severity of recent MIDs)
    - General threat level (i.e. number of MIDs in past 10 years)
    - Common enemy (i.e. if both sides fought against same state)

Additional notes:

- More controls: distance, major power, learning (i.e. regarding past alliances)
- Unit of analysis: dyad-year.

<!-- ### Interpreting the Regression Output

Find the following objects in the regression table:

1. The numbers in parentheses
2. The numbers *not* in parentheses
3. The asterisks that appear next to some numbers.

### Interpreting the Regression Output



1. The numbers in parentheses

    - These are the **standard errors**.
    - They communicate a prediction error (of sorts).
    - However, their interpretation depends on the associated numbers not in parentheses.

2. The numbers *not* in parentheses

    - These are the **regression coefficients**.
    - They communicate the estimated change in the DV for a unit-change in the IV.
    - Determine if it's positive or negative (recall: relationships).
    - However, their substantive interpretation depends on the presence/absence of asterisks.

3. The asterisks that appear next to some numbers.

    - These communicate the **statistical significance**.
    - i.e. is the estimated positive/negative effect discernible from zero?
    - If so, we say that the IV has a "significant" (i.e. highly unlikely to be zero) effect on the DV. -->

### Careful Interpretation of Significance

Some conclusions about who forms alliances:

- Democracies form alliances with each other.
- Culturally similar states form alliances with each other.
- More threatened states form alliances; enemies don't.


<!-- ### Careful Interpretation of Significance

Notice the process looks similar to a deductive approach.

- i.e. if H is true, then the parameter estimates for X1 will be statistically significant.
	- alternatively, and more formally: if the hypothesis is true, the test statistic will be drawn from a probability distribution that matches the population parameter.
- If X1 is statistically significant, we "fail to reject the hypothesis".
	- We don't "prove" the hypothesis or "accept" it. It just lives to be refuted another day.
- If X1 is not significant, we reject the hypothesis.
	- This is akin to denying the consequent.

### Some Cautions about the Regression Table

Regression tables shouldn't be daunting, but they can be misleading.

- Mind the distribution of the DV.
- Don't mistake "significant" for "large" or "very important"

    - For now, just look for significance to assess non-zero positive or negative effects.
- The constant is our estimate of Y when all Xs are zero.

    - It's not terribly important for beginners learning to evaluate regressions in political science.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion


- Classifiable into offense/defense, non-aggression, neutrality, entente.
- Alliances constitute a security-autonomy trade-off.
- Homophily (in institutions/culture) and shared sense of threat are important correlates of alliance formation.
