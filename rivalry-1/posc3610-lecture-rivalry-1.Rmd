### MIC of the Day: The Azeri-Armenian War of 1993–1994 (MIC#3564)

```{r mic-of-the-day, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("mic3564.jpg")
```

### The Azeri-Armenian War of 1993–1994 (MIC#3564)

**Synopsis**:

- *Who*: Armenia (w/ Russia) vs. Azerbaijan (w/ Iran, Turkey)
- *Why*: Consolidation of Nagorno-Karabakh amid splintering of USSR
    - N-K was more Armenian than Azeri, but was administered by Azerbaijan
- *What (Happened):* CIS-brokered ceasefire; Armenia victory
    - De facto autonomy for N-K (now: Artsakh), unification w/ Armenia
    - Armenian fatalities: 1,732 (min.) to 5,751 (max.)
    - Azeri fatalities: 2,600 (min.) to 4,670 (max.)
    
### (Somewhat) Current Map of the Situation

```{r arm-aze-map, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("arm-aze-map.png")
```


### What is Happening Here?

- A small group of dyads are disproportionately responsible for large conflicts/wars (Maoz and Mor, 2002).
- Seems that previous crises makes future crises more likely (Colaresi and Thompson, 2002).

### Some Quick-Cut Stats


Per Gibler and Miller (Forthcoming): 

- The top 10 most confrontation-prone dyads are responsible for >18% of all confrontations.
- The top 10 most confrontation-prone dyads are responsible for about 13% of all approx. fatalities.
- 50% of all confrontation dyads have more than one confrontation in their history.

# Rivalries
### What is a Rivalry?

We call this phenomenon a "rivalry."

- States view each other as threats and compete against each other.
- This can obviously vary in size and scope (e.g. Cold War vis-a-vis Eritrea-Ethiopia).

Conflict, and esp. conflict recurrence, follows under these circumstances.

- Importantly: conflict is not "IID" (independent and identically distributed).

## How Do We Identify Rivalries?
### How Do We Identify Rivalries?

1. Dispute density
2. Diplomatic history

### Dispute Density Approach

Most classic rivalry scholarship identified rivalries based on past disputes.

### Wayman (2000)

Wayman (2000) used MIDs to identify rivalries on three criteria:

1. Severity: must have at least five reciprocated MIDs.
2. Durability: must be at least 25 years between first MID and the termination of the last one.
3. Continuity: cannot have a gap of more than 10 years between last disputes.

### Diehl and Goertz (2000)

Diehl and Goertz (2000) take a different approach in their rivalry classification:

1. Enduring: at least six disputes over a period lasting at least 20 years.
2. Isolated: Two or fewer disputes (i.e. less intense)
3. Proto: More than two, fewer than six.

Klein, Goertz, and Diehl (2006) drop this classification and simply code rivalry for at least three MIDs between 1816-2001.

- Gaps of around 50 years constitute new rivalry onset.

### Diplomatic History Approach

A better way to identify rivalries may entail examining diplomatic histories (Thompson and Dreyer, 2012).

- Do states communicate to each other as threats?
- Do their diplomatic offices discuss of others as threats?
- Are their military exercises conducted with a target in mind?



### Differences Between the Approaches

There's a clear difference in approach:

- Dispute density: use previous disputes to identify rivals.
- Diplomatic history: read diplomatic documents and make subjective judgment calls.

This does lead to a lot of different identifications.

- Thompson and Dreyer (2012) note six different rivalry measures produce consensus in only 6.5% of cases.



### Do We Prefer One Approach to the Other?

Yes generally, Thompson and Dreyer's diplomatic history approach.

- Dispute density approaches identify rivalries where they make no sense (e.g. Ecuador-U.S, Canada-U.S.)
- Diplomatic history requires judgment calls but lends to better face validity.


More importantly: dispute density approaches use past conflicts to predict future conflicts.

- Diplomatic history approaches identify rivalries independent of conflicts.


### Classifying Rivalries

<!-- Thompson and Dreyer use "international rivalries" as umbrella term but rivalries clearly vary: -->

**Spatial**: contest control of territory, broadly defined 

- (e.g. Armenia-Azerbaijan)

**Positional**: competition for relative shares of influence 

- (e.g. Russia-U.S. [then and now])

**Ideological**: contest virtues of competing economic/political systems 

- (e.g. West/East Germany, South/North Yemen)
- Only one ideological rivalry *doesn't* have some other component to it (CRC-Nicaragua, 1948-1990).

**Interventionary**: states intervene to reduce threat/acquire leverage

- Note: This type is almost exclusively a SSA phenomenon (e.g. DRC-Rwanda).
- Some other rivalries have interventionary components though (e.g. Honduras-Nicaragua in the 1980s)

## How Do Rivalries Form/End?
### How Do Rivalries Form/End?

Rivalry scholars assume two models for rivalry formation.

1. Punctuated Equilibrium
2. Evolutionary

  labs(title = "Punctuated Equilibrium Model of Rivalry",
       subtitle = "Exogenous ''shocks'' explain rivalry onset and termination, sandwiching baseline levels of hostility/severity.")

```

### "Shocks" and Rivalry Formation/Termination

"Shocks" that began rivalries:

- Cold War, generally (e.g. take your pick among the former Cominform states)
- The world wars (e.g. Russia-United States 1, Germany-Poland, Hungary-Serbia)
- Regime change (e.g. Iran-Iraq 2, Iran-Saudi Arabia)
- Territorial annexation (e.g. Japan-United States)

"Shocks" that ended rivalries:

- Cold War, generally (e.g. Russia-United States 1)
- The world wars (e.g. Germany-United States [1,2])
- Other wars (e.g. Mexico-United States, North Vietnam-South Vietnam)
- Regime change (e.g. SAF-Zambia; SAF-Zimbabwe)
- Territorial annexation (e.g .Spain-United States)

### Evolutionary Model of Rivalries

Hensel (1999) argues rivalries follow a life cycle.

- i.e. early, intermediate, and advanced
- Disputes become more likely and more severe the further along in the life cycle.

Implication: rivalries are more likely to end the longer they last (see: Bennett 1998).

### Rivalry Context, Conflict, and Termination

```{r}
Data[[3]] %>%
  group_by(rivalrycat) %>% 
  summarize(sum = sum(n_onsets),
            meanfatal = mean(sumfatal)) %>%
  mutate(meanfatal = format(round(meanfatal, 2), big.mark=",")) -> hold_this

td_rivalries %>%
  select(rivalryname, styear, endyear) %>% 
  left_join(Data[[3]], .) %>%
  filter(endyear != 2010) %>%
  group_by(rivalryname) %>%
  slice(n()) %>%
  group_by(rivalrycat) %>%
  summarize(n =n()) %>%
  left_join(hold_this, .) %>%
  kbl(., align = c("lccc"),
      longtable = TRUE, booktabs = TRUE,
      col.names = c("Category", "No. of Confs.", "Avg. Fatalities (in Confs.)", "No. of Terminations at Stage")) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 8) %>%
  footnote(general = "Data: Gibler and Miller (Forthcoming); Thompson and Dreyer (2012)",
           number = "Treat with some caution. Results tentative. Statistics on terminations omit rivalries ongoing as of 2010.",
           alphabet = "Rivalry stage determined analogously to Hensel (1999), but also Diehl and Goertz (2012).")

```

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

Why do disputes recur? Rivalry is one explanation.

- Disputes lead states to view each other as threats, which begets more disputes.
- There are several identification schemes, but diplomatic history approaches do best.
- Inter-state conflict is not IID.
