# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Discuss what we know about how states finance war.*


### Confrontation of the Day: MIC#0089 (Franco-Spanish War)

```{r mic-of-the-day, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# knitr::include_graphics("mic2331.jpg")

p1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("mic0089-1.jpg", scale = 1.1)
p2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("mic0089-2.jpg", scale = .8)

plot_grid(p1, p2)
```

### MIC#0089

- *Who*: France vs. Spain (Sept. 21, 1822 - Nov. 13, 1823)
- *Why*: Restoration of Ferdinand VII
- *What happened*:
  - 6 April: fighting starts on the banks of the Bidassoa
  - 21 August-27 September: surrender of A Coruña, Pamplona, San Sebastián
  - 31 August: Battle of Trocadero
  - 23 September: Cortes dissolves itself
  - 13 November: France finally leaves Spain

### The Fall out of MIC#0089

Spain actually defaults after this war.

- Ferdinand VII refused to honor debts accumulated by the liberal Cortes.
- This included £12.9 million to Haldimand and Sons, among a few other private lenders (prominently in the UK).

However, this was more a practicality than a "stand."

- Spain's finances led to the Florida sale (1819), the revolution in 1821, and accelerated the independence movements in Latin America.
- Spain couldn't secure a loan afterward from the Rothschild bank.

# How Do States Pay for War?
### How Do States Pay for War?

```{r w, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("w.png")
```

Debt. The answer is debt.

## The Centrality of Debt to War Finance
### The Centrality of Debt to War Finance

Debt is the foremost form of war finance.

- Almost 9 of 10 war participants resort to some form of borrowing to pay for war.

Debt is increasingly held externally.

- Before 1950, about 70% of states borrowed domestically. After 1950: about 40%.
- For external debts: 52% before 1950, 72% afterward.


## Why Debt?
### Why Debt?

```{r war-bonds, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# knitr::include_graphics("mic2331.jpg")

p3 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("buy-war-bonds.jpg", scale = .95)
p4 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("give-war-bonds-xmas.jpeg", scale = .95)

plot_grid(p3, p4)
```

### Some Assumptions

1. Citizens like to keep their money.
2. Leaders want to hold onto power.

### Some Takeaways

Citizens are willing to sacrifice their income, or at least say they are.

- Caveats: probably limited to unique (WW2) moment in time, and likely hypothetical and conditional.
- Strategic leaders assuredly know this, and try not to press their luck.

Leaders avoid interacting citizens with war finance where they can.

- Domestic taxation for war is effectively a new tax.

## State Capacity and the Endgoeneity of War Finance
### State Capacity and the Endgoeneity of War Finance

"War makes the state and the state makes war" (Tilly, 1990).

- Taxation may be optimal for financing war, but that depends on state capacity.
- War, in turn, increases state capacity for revenue extraction.
- However, this may attract the attention of a belligerent (e.g. Japan v. China in the late 1930s).
- This in turn drives up interest for (external) borrowing.

## Sovereign-to-Sovereign Lending
### Sovereign-to-Sovereign Lending

Private lenders were more common in the past; now it's sovereign lenders.

- Indeed, the rise of sovereign lending is central to understanding the global monetary system as a whole.

Sovereign lending comes with associated quirks.

- Sidesteps "guns vs. butter" trade-off for recipient.
- Revenue potential for lender.
- Creates post-war dependency.
- Permits issue linkage.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

States must finance war.

- Lot of recent energy into this topic. Data are playing catch-up.
- Leaders try to play "hide-and-seek" strategy (from public) with war finance.
- Debt, prominently sovereign-to-sovereign debt, is central to war finance.
- Wartime loans are an instrument of international power.
