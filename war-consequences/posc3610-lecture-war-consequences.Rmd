# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*The consequences of war seem intuitive, but how would we know? How can we measure them?*

### MIC of the Day: Paraguayan War (MIC#1590)

```{r mic-of-the-day, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.cap = "Zoom-in of Pedro Américo's (1877) 'Battle of Avaí'"}
knitr::include_graphics("battle-avai.jpg")
```


### Assorted Consequences of the Paraguayan War

- Paraguay loses ~40% of its pre-war territory.
- Paraguay disappears from state system until 1876.
- Paraguay loses at least half (as much as 69%) of its pre-war population.
- Paraguay's economy shrunk at least 20% (as much as 66%) from its pre-war size.
    - *ed. note*: my napkin-math simulations.
- Paraguay indebted to Brazil until 1943.
- End of rivalry between Paraguay and neighbors.
- Ascent of Brazilian military as dominant domestic player.
- Widespread domestic revolts in Argentina (incl. three civil wars in 10-year period)

### A Problem of Assessment

No doubt war has consequences, but how do we assess them? Effects can be:

- Permanent and temporary
- Short-term and long-term
- Direct or indirect
- Positive and negative

Indeed, war can have positive side effects (or "externalities").

# A Framework for Understanding the Consequences of War
### A Framework

Thompson (1993) suggests a framework for evaluating the consequences of war.

1. National Consequences
2. International Consequences

## National Consequences of War
###  National Consequences of War

We can further classify national consequences of war by three factors.

1. Economic conditions
2. Demographic factors
3. Sociopolitical conditions

### Economic Conditions

Intuitively, war destroys stuff.

- Destroys land, labor, and capital
- Siphons labor force toward war effort

However, some effects can be positive.

- Namely: innovations in research, tech, and even medicine.

### Economic Conditions

In fact, it's not even clear there is a discernible negative economic consequence to war.

- Koubi (2005) finds war *increased* economic growth in her sample of countries from 1960-1989.

### Demographic Factors

War does have pervasive effects on demography.

- Increases mortality rates
- Stunts marriage rates and child birth


Should be no surprise this disproportionately targets young men.

```


### Demographic Factors

But again, some effects can be positive.

- WWI empowered suffrage movements
- Vietnam War empowered broader movements of franchise for kids your age.
- WWII further integrated the military and the civilian workforce.

### Sociopolitical Conditions

"War makes the state and the state makes war."

- War empowers state capacity
- War increases revenue/extraction/spending.

Some effects might actually be positive in the long-run.


### War and Regime Change

By far, most concerns for sociopolitical consequences of war concern regime change.

## International Consequences of War
### International Consequences of War

We can lump the international consequences of war to these factors.

1. Geopolitical situations/orientations
2. Territorial changes
3. Changes in relative capabilities
4. Alignment patterns
5. Economic consequences
6. Rivalry/recurring conflict (i.e. the next week)

## The Phoenix Factor
### The Phoenix Factor

What are the economic effects of major wars? Some arguments:

- "Scissor effect": winners and losers diverge until economic uncertainty brings the winner to the loser.
- "Permanent loss": winners and losers diverge and that stays in the long-run.

Against this, Organski and Kugler (1977, 1980) argue for a "Phoenix Factor."

- i.e. economic consequences of the war are temporary.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

War has consequences, so how do you assess them?

- National/international effects
- Clear negative effects and positive externalities
- The important effect on leader tenure
