# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Discuss why inter-state conflict is not IID (independent and identically distributed).*


### Confrontation of the Day: Operation Skerwe (MIC#3070)


```{r mic-of-the-day, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

p1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("mic3070-1.png", scale = 0.8)
p2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("mic3070-2.png", scale = 0.8)
#p3 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("img/crush-india-march.png", scale = 0.9)
# p4 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("img/anti-china-protest-2011.jpg", scale = 0.9)

plot_grid(p2, p1)
# nitr::include_graphics("friedrich-franz-crop.jpg")
```


### MIC#3070

- *Who*: South Africa vs. Mozambique (13 April 1983 - 17 October 1983)
- *Why*: anti-apartheid/support for ANC, basically
- *What happened*:
  - 13 April: Mozambique detains a SAF fishing vessel
  - 20 May: car bomb in Pretoria, outside air force HQ
  - 23 May: Operation Skerwe
  - 17 Oct: another raid in Maputo, killing at least six
  
This rivalry had three total confrontations (MIC#1441 in 1975, MIC#2801 in 1987) before concluding with the end of apartheid.

### Rivalry and Conflict

Rivalry captures/explains two problems in the study of inter-state conflict.

- Conflict is not IID.
- States that fight once are likely to fight again.

"Rivalry" defines these relationships, explaining conflict clustering and conflict recurrence.


### Rivalry and Conflict

What explains conflict *within* the rivalry?

- i.e. we know to this point rivals are more likely to have (recurrent) conflict than non-rivals.

However, rivalry defines a relationship, and conflict varies inside it.


### What Can We Do Here?

Let's put our own spin on this.

- *Unit of analysis*: non-directed *rivalry* dyad-years
    - e.g. USA-CUB 1959, USA-CUB 1960, etc.
    - Temporal domain: 1900-2010
    - *N*: 6,712
- *DVs*: confrontation onset, confrontation fatalities (min., max.), escalation to dyadic war.
    - You've seen these before by now.
    
### *International/Dyadic Factors*

- CINC proportion (W/S)
- Alliance (defense)
- Major power status in dyad
- Land contiguity


### Domestic Factors

- Joint democracy
- Leadership change
- Min. GDP per capita
- Min. leader willingness to use force (Carter and Smith, 2020)


### Individual Factors

*Individual Factors*:

- Rivalry type (positional, ideological, interventionary)
    - Benchmarked to spatial rivalry (i.e. fixed effect)


### "Shock" Factors

- Six-year period after Cold War ended [1990:1995]
- Six-year period after WW2 ended [1945:1950]
- Irregular leadership change
- Natural disaster category (a la Akcinaroglu and Radziszewski, 2021)


### Other Notes

Briefly:

- Adjustments for temporal dependence/sample selection.
- "Perfect predictors" (separation) should be obvious from results.
    - i.e. look for unreasonably large coefficients with comically larger standard errors.

             stars = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 7)

```


### International/Dyadic Factors and Rivalry/Conflict


- Land-contiguous rivals are more likely to have confrontations, if not escalation/severe conflicts.
- Major power rivalries have a mostly robust effect across all models.
- Defense pacts among rivals don't deter onset, but do deter escalation.
- Wealthier rivals are less likely to see their confrontations escalate.

             stars = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 7)

```


### Domestic Factors and Rivalry/Conflict

- No real effect of leader transitions and conflict within rivalries.
- No real effect of joint democracy (beyond the perfect predictor)
- The more hawkish the leaders in rivalry, the more likely the conflict

```{r reg-table-3, echo=F, eval=T, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 8.5, warning = F, message = F, results="asis"}

modelsummary(list("Conf. Onset" = Mods[[1]], 
                  "Min. Fatalities" = Mods[[3]],
                  "Max. Fatalities" = Mods[[4]],
                  "Dyadic War" = Mods[[5]]),

                          "rivalry_facideological" = "Ideological Rivalry (vs. Spatial)",
                          "rivalry_facinterventionary" = "Interventionary Rivalry (vs. Spatial)"),
             stars = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 7)

```



### Individual Factors and Rivalry/Conflict

Some evidence spatial rivalries are more severe than other rivalries.

- Positional rivalries are more likely to have confrontations, but:
- ...those conflicts are less severe.
- Kinda the same with interventionary rivalries as well.

                  "Dyadic War" = Mods[[5]]),
             # output="latex",  
             longtable=TRUE,
             title = "The Effect of 'Shock' Factors on Inter-state Conflict in Rivalries",
             gof_omit = "IC|F|Log.|R2$|R2",
             coef_map = c("dyadirregular" = "'Irregular' Leader Transition",
                          "ndirdisastcat" = "Natural Disasters",
                          "post_cw" = "Post-Cold War",
                          "post_ww2" = "Post-WW2"),
             stars = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 7)

```


### Shock Factors and Rivalry/Conflict

- No real effect of 'irregular' leader transitions
- Natural disasters increase likelihood of confrontation onset, but decrease escalation.


# Conclusion
### Conclusion

We focus on distinction between rivals and non-rivals and neglect patterns within them.

- Escalatory: major powers, spatial rivalries, leader hawkishness
- De-escalatory: defense pacts, wealth, joint democracy
- Even "shocks" can cut both ways
