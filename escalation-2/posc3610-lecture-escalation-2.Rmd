# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Highlight why disputes, once initiated, escalate to war and why selection matters.*


### Territorial Disputes and War

Vasquez (1993, 1995) argues territorial issues are a root cause of war.

- He draws from evolutionary psychology, primitive anthropology, and sociobiology to make that argument.
- However, data limitations hindered an issue-politics paradigm in IR.

The release of version 2.0 of CoW-MID changed this.

- From there, a slew of scholarship argued territorial MIDs are more likely to lead to war.

### Non-Random Sampling and Selection Bias

However, MIDs are not a "random data-generating process" (DGP).

- i.e. Second Kashmir War (MID\#1312) was not a roll of the dice.
- The India-Pakistan dyad is not randomly drawn from an urn.

### Non-Random Sampling and Selection Bias


However, *all* our statistical models assume random DGP.

- This is the inference in inferential statistics.
- i.e. we infer about the population with a sample of the population.

MIDs are not randomly sampled. They're event data.

### Non-Random Sampling and Selection Bias

Important for our purposes. MIDs are events that, by definition, carry a higher probability of war.

- We don't know yet if territorial issues are truly war-prone.
- We just know territorial MIDs are more likely to lead to war and most wars are fought over territory.

### Possible Relationships Between Territory and War

![Table 1 in Senese and Vasquez (2003)](tab1.png)

### Table 1 in Senese and Vasquez (2003)

Our intuition suggests the top-left quadrant.

- i.e. disputed territory leads to MIDs.
- MIDs over distribution of territory lead to war.

### Table 1 in Senese and Vasquez (2003)

Other empirical scenarios are plausible and consistent with the data.

- States may have a lot of territorial MIDs but those rarely escalate (i.e. top-right)
- Territorial MIDs lead to war but states are reticent to initiate MIDs (i.e. bottom-left)
- We're all wrong about the bellicosity of territorial issues (i.e. bottom-right)

# Senese and Vasquez (2003)
### Senese and Vasquez (2003)

Senese and Vasquez (2003) will use a selection model to test the following:

- Dyads with territorial claims are more likely to culminate in MIDs.
- Territorial MIDs are more likely to escalate toward war.

### Senese and Vasquez's (2003) Design

*DVs*: 

- onset of a MID, war as highest fatality-level

This is functionally similar what Reed (2000) did in his model.

### Senese and Vasquez's (2003) Design

*Primary IVs*:

- Selection model: territorial claim (Huth, 1996)
- War/escalation model: Policy/Regime/Other MIDs to baseline of territorial MIDs.

If the steps-to-war intuition is correct:

- Dyad-years with territorial claims are more likely to lead to MIDs. And:
- MIDs over other issues should be less war-prone than territorial MIDs.

### Senese and Vasquez's (2003) Design

*Other IVs (i.e. controls)*

- Contiguity
- Minimum democracy (i.e. weak-link specification)
- Joint alliance
- Economic development
- Great power status (i.e. major-major, minor-minor)
    - Baseline: a major-minor (e.g. USA-Canada) dyad-year

### Senese and Vasquez's (2003) Design

Important methodological notes:

- Model includes peace years/splines for temporal auto-correlation.
- *Unit of analysis*: non-directed dyad-years
- *Temporal domain*: 1919-1992
- *Statistical method*: Heckman selection model
    - This will model selection into MID and then escalation to war simultaneously.

### What Do We Know About War Onset?

Senese and Vasquez (2003) have the following findings about war onset:

- Regime and Policy MIDs are much less likely to escalate to war than territorial MIDs.
    - Other MIDs drifts negative but estimated effect is diffuse.
- Joint democracy "weak-link" has a small but discernible negative effect on escalation.
- Allies are unlikely to escalate MIDs to war.
- Economic developed dyads are unlikely to escalate MIDs to war.
- Major-Majors (e.g. France-Germany) are more war-prone than Major-Minors (e.g. USA-Canada).
    - Also: Minor-Minors (e.g. Canada-Mexico) are less war-prone than Major-Minors.

### What Do We Know About Conflict?

Implications of Senese and Vasquez's (2003) unified model:

- *Importantly:* territorial claims lead to MIDs and MIDs over territory are the most war-prone.
    - This is ultimately what they're focused on testing.

### What Do We Know About Conflict?

Other findings: 

- Joint democracy is pacifying at both phases of conflict.
- Economically developed states have more MIDs, but are unlikely to escalate.
    - Both are inconsistent with Reed (2000) whose findings may be sensitive to his temporal domain.
- Contiguity leads to MIDs but most wars involve non-contiguous states.
    - This is still the case, btw, in the GML MID data.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

Senese and Vasquez (2003) present a unified explanation of territorial conflict.

- Territorial claims between states are likely to become militarized.
- Territorial MIDs are likely to lead to war.


It's important to separate correlates of dispute onset from dispute escalation.

- Factors that promote MID onset need not promote war onset.

<!-- ### How This Relates to International Conflict

Consider the familiar argument about territorial disputes and war.

- We know wars are fought over territory more than any other issue.
- We have arguments (e.g. Vasquez, 1993/1995) to explain this.

So, we know territorial disputes are likely to lead to war.

- We *don't* know that territory is truly war-prone.

How does this make sense?

### Possible Relationships between Territory and War

![Table 1 in Senese and Vasquez (2003)](tab1.png)

### Table 1 in Senese and Vasquez (2003)

Our intuition suggests top-left quadrant.

- i.e. territorial issues lead to disputes. Territorial disputes escalate to war.

Other empirical scenarios are plausible.

- Top-right quadrant: states have a lot of territorial disputes, but those rarely escalate to war.
- Bottom-left quadrant: states are reticent to initiate territorial disputes because those that are initiated likely become wars.
- Bottom-right quadrant: we're all wrong about the bellicosity of territorial issues.
 
Notice the conceivable scenarios still consistent with the claim territorial disputes lead to war?

###

![Table 1 in Reed (2000)](reed2000-tab1.png)

### Interpreting Reed's (2000) selection model

Implications of Reed's (2000) model:

- Power parity leads to MIDs, but MIDs between equals are less likely to lead to war.
- *Joint democracy leads to fewer MIDs, not necessarily fewer wars.*
    - Would be consistent with Senese's (1997) finding.
- Likewise: satisfied states have fewer MIDs, not necessarily fewer wars.
- Allies still have disputes, just unlikely to escalate to war.


###

![Table 2 in Senese and Vasquez (2003)](tab2.png)

### Table 2 in Senese and Vasquez (2003)

Table 2 supports the Senese and Vasquez' hypothesis about the danger of disputed territory.

- The war onset models tell us what we already know.
- Other issue-type MIDs are not as war-prone as territorial MIDs.
- The joint models illustrate territorial claims in a dyad lead to MIDs more than dyads without territorial claims.
- Other issue-type MIDs are not as war-prone as territorial MIDs in a sample selection model.


###

![Table 3 in Senese and Vasquez (2003)](tab3.png)

### Table 3 in Senese and Vasquez (2003)

How to read Table 3:

- Predicted probability of MID onset with territorial claim: .0088
- Predicted probability of MID onset without territorial claim: .0012
    - These are fortunately "rare events" but notice the lower-bound of the territorial claim probability does *not* overlap the upper-bound "no-territorial claim" probability.
- Likewise: predicted probability of territorial MID escalating to war: .312
- Predicted probability of a policy or regime MID escalating to war: no higher than .06

## Strategic Factors
### Influence Strategies

- Bullying (escalation for any response short of total acquiescence)
- Reciprocating (tit-for-tat responses)
- Appeasing (opposite of bullying: use of positive inducements instead of negative ones)
- Trial-and-error (i.e. "going with what works")

### Results of Influence Strategies

- Bullying is most frequently used strategy; also most likely to escalate.
- Reciprocating is most successful
- Appeasing has bad name post-Munich Crisis; also war-prone
- Trial-and-error leads to mixed results.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

It's important to separate correlates of dispute onset from dispute escalation.

- Factors that promote MID onset need not promote war onset.
- This can have important implications for scholarship like democratic peace. -->
