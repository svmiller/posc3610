## Book

Vasquez, John A. 2009. [*The War Puzzle Revisited*](https://www.amazon.com/Revisited-Cambridge-Studies-International-Relations/dp/0521708230). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. 

I list this book as "required reading" despite the fact the book will be "required" for the sake of the research paper. Almost all other readings for this class can be obtained by the student via any one of a number of electronic storage facilities on the World Wide Web (e.g., JSTOR, Blackwell-synergy). Clemson University has subscriptions to all these services, which can be accessed through the university's library website. I will note when a particular reading is inaccessible for Clemson students and make it available on Canvas.
