## Required Book

Mitchell, Sara McLaughlin and Jonn A. Vasquez (eds). 2021. [*What Do We Know About War*](https://www.amazon.com/What-Do-Know-about-War-dp-1538140098/dp/1538140098). Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield.

## Recommended Book (Required for Class Paper)

Vasquez, John A. 2009. [*The War Puzzle Revisited*](https://www.amazon.com/Revisited-Cambridge-Studies-International-Relations/dp/0521708230). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. 

I list this book as "recommended reading" despite the fact the book will be "required" for the sake of the research paper. I recommend two options toward obtaining this book instead of overpaying for it at the Clemson University bookstore. One, [the library has this available as a PASCAL eBook](http://libcat.clemson.edu/record=b3650354). Click that link and connect with your Clemson username and password to read the book online. You can even download some chapters as PDFs too. Those, like me, who still enjoy books in hard copy should [get the book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Revisited-Cambridge-Studies-International-Relations/dp/0521708230). Amazon will be cheaper than the Clemson University bookstore and it has [two-day shipping for students](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ie=UTF8&node=668781011).
