# Introduction
### Puzzle for Today

*What explains the duration of peace following a conflict?*

# Conflict Recurrence
### The Problem

All conflicts must end (Ikle, 1971) but disputes routinely recur.

- France and Prussia/Germany contested 12 MIDs between 1848-1941.
    - Four were wars and an additional six were uses of force.
- India and Pakistan have been in 39 MIDs between 1947 and 2010.
    - Only four were anything other than uses of force or war.
- Likewise, Israel and Syria have been in 34 MIDs between 1948 and 2010.

## Four Primary Approaches
### Four Primary Approaches

1. Bargaining
2. Enduring rivalries
3. Conflict management
4. Deterrence

### Bargaining Approaches to Conflict Recurrence

Bargaining models do well to endogenize (sic) all phases of conflict (see: Filson and Werner). Core findings:

- Power is central to explaining international conflict 
    - See also: asymmetric information
- Incentives to renegotiate (however arrived) explain conflict recurrence.
- Third-party mediation mollifies commitment problems.

### Enduring Rivalries and Conflict Recurrence

Intuitively, most conflict recurrence is between enduring rivals.

- e.g. India-Pakistan, France-Prussia/Germany, etc.
- Rivalry scholars tend to treat this as a sample selection issue.

There is some focus on how dispute outcomes facilitate new dispute onset.

- Hensel (1994): 93% of disputes followed by a decisive outcome are followed by a new dispute (in Latin America).

### Conflict Management and Conflict Recurrence

Conflict management scholars place high emphasis on how disputes end.

- e.g. third-party intervention, UN peacekeeping missions, even regime type.
- Generally, more multilateralism and more negotiation -> more stability

Some core findings:

- Third-party interventions are good for peace.
- UN PKOs -> more stability after disputes.

Scholars additionally quibble about selection issues.

- e.g. do PKOs and mediators follow the more difficult conflicts or the easier ones?

### Conflict Recurrence as Deterrence Failure?

Scholars in this vein see conflict recurrence as a form of deterrence failure. Findings:

- Imposed settlements are more peaceful than negotiated ones.
- Cease-fires can help maintain peace.
- Victor-imposed regime change are followed by longer peace spells.

## Settlement and Recurrent Conflict
### "Peace for Our Time"

### Announcing Unconditional Surrender Ultimatum in Casablanca

### Types of Settlement

- **Negotiated**: an agreement, formal or informal, struck by both sides of a conflict absent any attempt of external imposition.
- **Imposed**: an agreement forced on another state without invitation.
- **None**: a dispute ends because both sides stop fighting without any agreement about the pre-war status quo or conflict.

```{r, eval=T, echo=F, fig.width=14, fig.height=8.5, warning=F, message=F}

MIDA %>%
  group_by(settle) %>%
  summarize(sum = n()) %>%
  filter(settle != -9) %>%
  mutate(cat = c("Negotiated", "Imposed", "None", "Unclear"),
         perc = round((sum/sum(sum))*100, 2),
         perc = paste0(perc,"%")) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(cat, sum)) + theme_steve_web() +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "black", color="black", alpha=I(0.6)) +
  geom_text( aes(label=perc), vjust=-.5, colour="black",
            position=position_dodge(.9), size=4) +
  xlab("Settlement Type") + ylab("Number of MIDs") +
  labs(title = "Most MIDs (67%) End in No Settlement Type",
       subtitle = "Most MIDs stop because both sides stop fighting and not necessarily that they ''agreed'' to stop fighting.",
       caption = "Data: GML MID Data (v. 2.01)")

```

### Why Should Imposed Settlements Be More Peaceful?

Quackenbush argues imposed settlements are a case of unilateral deterrence.

- In mutual deterrence, both sides need to be deterred.
- In unilateral deterrence, only one side (i.e. the loser) needs to be deterred.

Unilateral deterrence is actually more peaceful than mutual deterrence.

###

| **Settlement Type** | **Events** | **E(Events)** | **Chi-sq** | **p-Value** |
|:--------------------|:----------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
| Imposed | 237 | 353.08 | 46.84 | <.001 |
| No Settlement | 1466 | 1341.87 | 31.82 | <.001 |
| Negotiated | 427 | 435 | .19 | .663 |

Table: Log-Rank Tests for Settlement Types and Peace Duration (Quackenbush, 2014)

Notice: we observe fewer peace failures if the settlement in the previous dispute was imposed.

- We observe *more* peace failures if there was no settlement type whatsoever.

```


### Empirical Findings

Imposed settlements least likely to be followed by peace failure than other settlement types.

- Follows implications of perfect deterrence theory on unilateral deterrence.

Other findings:

- Jointly democratic disputes have longer peace spells.
- Changes in relative power -> peace failure.
    - This importantly goes away the longer the peace spell.
- Contiguous states have shorter peace spells than states further away.
- No differences between war and MIDs.
    - Until you model an interaction with time.

```

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

Why do disputes recur?

- Four primary theoretical perspectives
- Bargaining models assume changes in relative power drive conflict recurrence.
- Deterrence models see conflict recurrence as deterrence failure.
    - Counterintuitively: settlement imposition works better than settlement negotiation.
