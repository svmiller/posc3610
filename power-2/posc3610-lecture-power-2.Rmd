# Power Transition Theory 
### Power Transition Theory

Power transition theory (PTT) has a curious origin.

- Grand theories and research paradigms are typically introduced in articles or scholarly books.
- PTT was introduced in a 1958 introductory textbook by AFK Organski, titled *World Politics*.

### Anarchy and Hierarchy

The basic premise of PTT is that the international system is *hierarchic*.

- Anarchy is an unexceptional observation according to Organski.

A power pyramid is a better understanding of the international system.
 
- Hegemon
- Great powers
- Middle powers
- Minor powers

### 

![A hypothetical power pyramid](pyramid.jpg)

### Status Quo and Revisionist States

States are either status quo states or revisionist states.

- Status quo states are those that are satisfied with the current conduct of international
politics.
    - The hegemon is by definition a status quo state.
- Revisionist states are dissatisfied with the current order.

This leads to an important divergence with neorealism.

- States in PTT are policy-motivated, not strictly survival-oriented.

## A Critique of Power Transition Theory
### A Critique of Power Transition Theory

We should raise several critical questions about this approach.

1. How do we know status quo/revisionist ex ante?
2. Why didn't the U.S. and Soviet Union fight?
3. Why does the power transition war happen?

### Status Quo and Revisionist States

PTT's hypothesis is an implied boolean proposition.

- Revisionist AND great power AND power transition --> war.
- PTT distinguishes itself from neorealism with this assumption of policy motivations.

So how do we know a state is "revisionist?"

- We typically think of Imperial/Nazi Germany as the classic case of this.

Notice the inferential problem?

### The Measurement Problem

We need an ex ante indicator of a revisionist state. Attempts include:

- National size and development (Houweling and Siccama, 1988)
- Gross national income (Organski and Kugler, 1980)
- Demographics/birth rates (e.g. Kugler, 2006)
- UN roll call votes (Reed et al. 2008; Sample, 2017)
- Territorial claims/disputes (Sample, 2017)

### The Measurement Problem

Each of these proposals have significant problems.

- GNI and size proxy "power" and not revisionism.
    - i.e. they measure why bargaining breaks down and not the contested policy benefit.
- Similar statement can be made for demographics/birth rates, but those predict poorly.
- UN votes impose global measure when most conflict is dyadic/local.

Territorial claims better get at this, but it's not clear it's helping PTT's case.

- Disputed territory is a different problem altogether.

### Why Fight a Power Transition War?

It's not yet evident why the power transition war is fought.

- For declining hegemon: *act now*.
- For rising great power: wait.

Put in other words, the power transition war happens when it makes the least sense to fight it.


# A Dyadic Assessment of Power and Conflict
### What Does This Look Like Dyadically?

**Unit of analysis**: non-directed dyad-year

- *dyad*: a pairing of any two states (e.g. USA-Canada, India-Pakistan)
- *year*: should be intuitive
- *non-directed*: USA-Canada and Canada-USA are observationally the same.
    - Useful for explaining simple onsets.
    - Operationally: keep the dyad where `ccode2` > `ccode1`.
    
###

```{r sample-dyad-years-usa-can, eval=T, echo=F}

cow_ddy %>%
  select(ccode1, ccode2, year) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  kable(., caption="A Simple Table of Ten Dyad Years for the U.S. (2) and Canada (20)",
        longtable = T, booktabs = TRUE)

```

### Dependent Variables

**Dependent Variables**: (i.e. the thing(s) we want to explain)

- *confrontation onset*: binary, indicates a unique confrontation onset in dyad-year
- *sum of minimum fatalities*: total (minimum) estimated fatalities in dyad-year
- *sum of maximum fatalities*: total (maximum) estimated fatalities in dyad-year
- *dyadic war*: whether a confrontation escalated to over 1,000 dyadic (minimum) fatalities

### 

```{r sample-dyad-years-ind-pak, eval=T, echo=F}

Data[[1]] %>%
  kable(., caption="A Simple Table of Ten Dyad Years for India (750) and Pakistan (770)",
        longtable = T, booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 8)

```

### Main Independent Variable

**Main Independent Variable**: CINC proportion (weaker/stronger)

- *Intuition:* higher values = more equal dyadic pairings.
- *Neorealism*: more equal pairings should be less conflict-prone.
- *PTT*: more equal pairings should be more conflict-prone (assuming other things).

This is what we are interested in primarily as a "cause" of the "effect."

###

```{r isr-syr-capabilities, echo=F, eval=T, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 8.5}

isr_syr %>%
  select(ccode1, year, cinc1) %>%
  rename(ccode = ccode1,
         cinc = cinc1) -> syr

isr_syr %>%
  select(ccode2, year, cinc2) %>%
  rename(ccode = ccode2,
         cinc = cinc2) %>%
  bind_rows(syr, .) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(year, cinc, color=ccode, linetype=ccode)) +
  theme_steve_web() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2020, by=10)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.1) +
  labs(color = "", linetype="",
       x = "", y = "CINC Score",
       title = "CINC Scores and Proportions (Weaker/Stronger) of Israel and Syria, 1948-2016",
       subtitle = "Both sides were historically evenly matched, even as Israel gets the better of most confrontations.") -> p1

isr_syr %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(year, ndircincprop)) + theme_steve_web()  +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2020, by=10)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.1) +
  labs(x = "", y = "CINC Proportion (Weaker/Stronger)",
       caption = "Data: Correlates of War National Material Capabilities (6.0)") -> p2



p1/p2

```


### Control Variables

**Control Variables**: (i.e. things we believe may confound this relationship)

- land contiguity, major powers in the dyad, defense pact, joint democracy, advanced economies
- This is very much a "Dangerous Dyads" type of analysis (Bremer, 1992).

**Other notes**: (i.e. things that academics care a lot about)

- Confrontation data: Gibler and Miller (forthcoming)
- Sample: politically relevant dyads (i.e. neighbors and/or dyads with a major power)
- Onset estimated using logistic regression. 
- Fatalities estimated with Heckman sample correction, selecting on ongoing confrontations.
    - Otherwise: basic OLS ("linear regression").
- War model is probit with Heckman sample correction.

### How to Interpret a Regression Table Like This

1. Find the variable(s) of interest.
2. Look for direction (positive/negative)
3. Look for "stars" (to determine statistical significance)

```{r reg-table-2, echo=F, eval=T, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 8.5, warning = F, message = F, results="asis"}

modelsummary(list("Conf. Onset" = Mods[[1]], "Min. Fatalities" = Mods[[3]], 
                  "Max. Fatalities" = Mods[[4]],
                  "Dyadic War" = Mods[[5]]),
             output="latex",  longtable=TRUE,
             title = "The Important Results of Our Analysis (Omitting the Control Variables)",
             gof_omit = "IC|F|Log.|R2$|R2",
             coef_map = c("ndircincprop" = "CINC Proportion"),
             stars = TRUE)  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 8)  %>%
  column_spec(1, italic = FALSE, color='#000000')

```


###

```{r reg-table-3, echo=F, eval=T, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 8.5, warning = F, message = F, results="asis"}

modelsummary(list("Conf. Onset" = Mods[[1]], "Min. Fatalities" = Mods[[3]], 
                  "Max. Fatalities" = Mods[[4]],
                  "Dyadic War" = Mods[[5]]),

             coef_map = c("ndircincprop" = "CINC Proportion"),
             stars = TRUE)  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 8) %>%
  column_spec(c(2, 3), color="#00cc00") %>%
  column_spec(c(4,5), color="#cc0000") %>%
  row_spec(3, color="#000000", bold=FALSE)

```

###

```{r reg-table-4, echo=F, eval=T, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 8.5, warning = F, message = F, results="asis"}

modelsummary(list("Conf. Onset" = Mods[[1]], "Min. Fatalities" = Mods[[3]], 
                  "Max. Fatalities" = Mods[[4]],
                  "Dyadic War" = Mods[[5]]),
            # output="latex",  longtable=TRUE,
             title = "The Important Results of Our Analysis (Omitting the Control Variables, Color Coded, Identifying Significance)",
             gof_omit = "IC|F|Log.|R2$|R2",
             coef_map = c("ndircincprop" = "CINC Proportion"),
             stars = TRUE)  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 8) %>%
  column_spec(c(2, 3), color="#00cc00") %>%
  column_spec(c(4,5), color="#cc0000") %>%
  column_spec(2, bold=TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(3, color="#000000", bold=FALSE)

```

### The Takeaways


- The more equal the dyad, the greater the likelihood of a confrontation onset (positive and significant).
- No discernible effect of dyadic power parity on minimum/maximum fatalities (notice: no "stars")
- No discernible effect of dyadic power parity on escalation to dyadic war.


# Conclusion
### Conclusion

PTT offers a different structural perspective for systemic insecurity/war.

- Hierarchy and not anarchy, peace through preponderance and not parity, policy-oriented behavior vs. security-oriented behavior.
- What is "revisionist" still plagues this program.

Dyadically:

- Power parity is positively associated with confrontation onset.
- No relationship with severity of the confrontation.

All told:

- Think of power as a means and not an end.
- Power is our more ubiquitous concept in IR, if not (perhaps) our most important.
