# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Highlight why disputes, once initiated, escalate to war and why selection matters.*

### A Buried Lede

We've spent much effort looking at the correlates of war by reference to MID onset.

- Understandable: war is a rare event. MIDs are more common.
- However, war is ultimately what we want to explain.

Importantly, the same factors that coincide with MID onset need not coincide with MID escalation.

### A Typology of Escalation

MIDs of interest cluster into different patterns.

- One-day/single-incident/unreciprocated MIDs that never escalate.
- Crises that become wars (e.g. July Crisis)
- Crises resolved short of war (e.g. Agadir Crisis, Trent Affair, Cuban Missile Crisis)
- Fatal MIDs short of war (e.g. Kargil War, Falkland War, Operation Just Cause)

<!-- Percentage of MIDs that are:

- Unreciprocated (48.52%)
- One day in length (28.18%)
- One day, unreciprocated (21.42%)
- Six months or fewer, unreciprocated (44.75%)
    - ed. This follows the "six-month count" rule in the MID data.

It's difficult to imagine war following when your typical MID looks like this. -->

# How Do We Explain Escalation?
## Contextual Factors
### How Do We Explain Escalation?

We generally focus on two things:

1. Contextual factors
2. Strategic interaction between states

### Contextual Factors

Contextual influences on dispute escalation stay close to the "dangerous dyads" framework.

- Relative Power
- System polarity
- Alliances
- Contiguity
- Arms races
- Joint democracy
- Issue type

### The Problem of Selection

However, what's true for dispute onset may not be true for dispute escalation.

- States select into disputes looking down the proverbial game tree.

We would need to better model the **selection effects** in the disputes we do observe.

- We usually do this with a Heckman (1976) model.

### The Canonical Case of Selection


Heckman's motivating example was women in the labor force.

- Preliminary finding: more women are in the labor force, working longer hours, and getting higher wages.
- Marital status (divorced) and education are thought to explain this.

The issue: we only have wage data on women in the labor force.

- Married women work when the market wage *y* is greater than non-market wage ($y^*$).
- We only have wage data when $y > y^*$.
- Women's labor force participation data suffered from selection bias.

Two-stage selection modeling gives greater confidence to our covariates of women's wages in the labor force.

# Reed's (2000) Unified Statistical Model
### Reed's (2000) Design

*DVs*: 

- onset of a MID, escalation of MID to war

*IVs*:

- Power parity (i.e. weaker state's CINC/stronger state's CINC)
- Satisfaction with the status quo (i.e. alliance similarity w/ the US)
- Joint democracy (both states >=6 on Polity 2 score)
- Alliance (both states share a defense pact)
- Economic interdependence (volume of dyadic trade/country GDP [weak-link])
- Economic growth (rate of growth over three years of less-developed state)

### Reed's (2000) Design

Important methodological notes:

- Model includes peace years/splines for temporal auto-correlation
- *Unit of analysis*: politically relevant dyad-years
- *Temporal domain*: 1950-1985
- *Statistical method*: Heckman selection model
    - This will model selection into MID and then escalation to war simultaneously.

### What Do We Know About Dispute Onset?

Reed's simple model of MID onset has the following findings:

- Dyads with near equally powerful states are more likely to have MIDs.
- Joint democracies have fewer MIDs than jointly autocratic states (or mixed dyads).
- States satisfied with the U.S.-led status quo are less likely to have MIDs.
- Shared defense pacts have no effect on MID onset.
- Jointly developed states are less likely to have MIDs.
- Economic interdependence has no discernible effect.

### What Do We Know About Dispute Escalation?

Reed's simple model of MID escalation suggests:

- Power parity may lead to more MIDs but seems to have no effect on escalation.
- MIDs involving two democracies are *much* less likely to end up in war.
- MIDs involving two satisfied states are also much less likely to escalate.
- Economic interdependence seems to have a small *positive* effect on escalation.

### What Do We Know About Dispute Escalation?

Implications of Reed's (2000) unified model:

- Power parity leads to MIDs, but MIDs between equals are less likely to lead to war.
- *Joint democracy leads to fewer MIDs, not necessarily fewer wars.*
    - Would be consistent with Senese's (1997) finding.
- Likewise: satisfied states have fewer MIDs, not necessarily fewer wars.
- Allies still have disputes, just unlikely to escalate to war.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

It's important to separate correlates of dispute onset from dispute escalation.

- Factors that promote MID onset need not promote war onset.
- This can have important implications for scholarship like democratic peace.
