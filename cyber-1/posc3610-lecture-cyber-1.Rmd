# Introduction
### Goal for Today

*Introduce conflict through so-called 'cyber' capabilities, and what we can say about these patterns so far.*


### MIC of the Day: Another Spratly Island Confrontation (MIC#4699)


```{r mic-of-the-day, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# knitr::include_graphics("anti-china-protest-2011.jpg")

p2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("anti-china-protest-2011.jpg", scale = .98)

plot_grid(p1, p2)
```


### MIC#4699

- *Who*: China v. Vietnam (5 May 2011 - 5 July 2011)
- *Why*: maritime boundary dispute in the South China Sea (Spratly Islands)
- *What happened*:
    - May 2011: China patrol vessel cuts cable on Vietnamese survey boat (in DRV's waters)
    - June 2011: assorted shows of force/vessel chases between both sides
    - July 2011: Chinese soldiers board DRV fishing vessel and assault a crew member.

### DCID Cyber Incident #209

- *Who*: China v. Vietnam (3 June 2011 - 6 June 2011)
- *Why*: maritime boundary dispute in the South China Sea (Spratly Islands)
    - A coordinated offensive strike to take down websites/disrupt online activities
- *What happened*:
    - Chinese hackers defaced over 200 Vietnamese websites (~10% of which were government websites)
    - Government websites targeted were non-military, mostly agricultural ministry websites
    - Apparent culprits "3King" and "Xiao Lan" were from "Honker Union", a hacker collective from Yancheng
    - Hackers also apparently stole some sensitive information from these websites as well.
    
### What is 'Cyber Conflict?'

"Cyber conflict", broadly understood (Valeriano and Manness, 2015) is:

- the use of computational technology
- for malevolent and destructive purposes to
- impact/change diplomatic/military interactions between states

Notice the phenomenon straddles how we might define things like "(militarized, inter-state) confrontations" and "terrorism".

- i.e. there are clear political aims for initiators against targets, including their respective governments.
- However, initiators/targets need not be "official" government actors/forces

### Why 'Cyber?'

The etymology of 'cyber' comes from Greek, meaning "governance."

- Real origin story: rise of 'cybernetics' in the 1940s-1960s, studying self-governing systems (e.g. thermostats, cruise control).
- 'Cyberspace' first mentioned in 1982 by (SC-born) essayist William Gibson.

Even better origin story:

> Cyber is such a perfect prefix. Because nobody has any idea what it means, it can be grafted onto any old word to make it seem new, cool â€” and therefore strange, spooky. [New York magazine, Dec. 23, 1996]

# The Dyadic Cyber Incident and Campaign Dataset (DCID)
## What Does 'Cyber Conflict' Look Like?
### The Dyadic Cyber Incident and Campaign Dataset (DCID)

The Dyadic Cyber Incident and Campaign Dataset (DCID) records every instance of dyadic cyber incidents from 2000-2016.

- *Units*: rival dyads (Klein et al., 2006; Thompson, 2001)
- Initiators must be governments or government-sponsored groups.
    - e.g. "Fancy Bear" (i.e. the group that hacked the DNC in 2016) is (from what we know) a GRU outfit.
    - "Berserk Bear" (i.e. the group that hacked the whole damn government from 2019 to 2020) is effectively a state-sponsored (FSB) hacker group, albeit one with a lot of freelancers.
- Targets need not be government actors.

Total number of known cyber incidents: 226

### Target Types

<!-- https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-hack-almost-brought-the-u-s-military-to-its-knees/ -->

Cyber incidents go after one of three groups in a state.

1. Private/non-state (e.g. the Sony hack in 2014 [incident 101])
2. Government/non-military (e.g. China's hack of Vietnam in 2011)
3. Government/military (e.g. Russia momentarily seized the JCS' [unclassified] email system in March 2015 [incident: 19])


### The Sony Hack (#101)

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("the-interview.jpg")
```

### The Sony Hack (#101)

On 24 Nov. 2014, a DPRK hacker group ("Guardians of Peace") leaked 100 TBs of Sony's data. Including:

- personal information about employees
- email communication between employees
- Copies of upcoming films/plans for future films

*Why*: Sony produced *The Interview*, a then forthcoming film about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un.

- The group demanded Sony withdraw the film, threatening terror attacks against cinemas that showed it.

*What happened*: 

- Sony withdrew *The Interview* and cancelled all premieres.
- Sony lost about $35 million on IT repairs, and ate about $30 million on the film.

### Cyber Objectives

Analogous to terrorism, different cyber incidents carry different cyber objectives.

1. Disruption
2. Short-term espionage
3. Long-term espionage
4. Degradation

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

- Cyber incidents emerged as tools for weaker (but still sophisticated) states to signal dissatisfaction with rivals.
- Cyber aims are often limited, as are the cyber methods.
